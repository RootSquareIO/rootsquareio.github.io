At Rootsquare.io, we specialize in advanced solutions for detecting duplicates in large databases, particularly within the healthcare sector. Our proprietary technology is capable of identifying nuanced cases such as duplicates from marriage/separation, and even distinguishing twins with remarkable accuracy.  

In this post, we showcase the application of our solution to the **North Carolina Voter Registration Database**, where we identified **2619 pairs potential duplicates**. Our solution clears out any outstanding potential duplicates with specific type duplicate classification.


This post demonstrates our solution's application on the **North Carolina Voter Registration Database** (retrieved from https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/data/ncvoter_Statewide.zip). We started with 8,561,891 unique NC voter IDs and filtered out historical voters using the "status_cd" column, leaving **6,455,829** active records for processing. 
Our solution identified **2,619 pairs potential duplicates**, prioritizing accuracy and minimizing false positives.

These include:  
- Standard duplicates (same individuals with multiple records)  
- Duplicates caused by **marriage/separation**  
- Cases involving **twins**  

We prioritize accuracy to ensure our solution flags true duplicates while minimizing the risk of incorrectly identifying separate individuals. 
This minimizes the need for manual review and ensures data integrity.

**Our solution depicts high accuracy for each category X%,X%, and X%, respectively.**

- **Demographics Subplots**: *Figure illustrating age, race, party, voter registration status, and gender distributions among duplicates.*

- **Findings**:  
  - Highest sex rate: Female-Female, Male-Male
  - Higest race rate: B (Black) 
  - Highest party rate: Dem-Dem, UNA-UNA (Democrats) 
  - Highest age rate: 18-32 years old

**References:**  
- *Studies aligning with race and sex distribution findings for twins.*  
- The twin birth rate in the United States in 2022 was 31.2 twins per 1,000 births. The twin birth rate rose for Black women from 40.6 in 2021 to 41.4 in 2022.  The twin birth rate remained essentially unchanged for White women (32.5 to 32.6) and Hispanic women (24.2 to 24.5). ( National Vital Statistics Reports - Volume 73, Number 2 April 4, 2024 )
- Data births of twins peakes aroud 2000s as depicted by the age of twins duplicates (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db351-h.pdf)
- The higher proportion of female twins compared to male twins is influenced by several biological factors:

    1. **In-Utero Survival Rates**: Male fetuses generally have higher in-utero mortality rates than female fetuses. This disparity is more pronounced in twin pregnancies, leading to a higher proportion of surviving female twins. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin).

    2. **Sex Ratio at Birth**: While the natural sex ratio at birth slightly favors males (approximately 105 males for every 100 females), the increased male fetal mortality in twin pregnancies results in a more balanced or slightly female-skewed sex ratio among twins.
